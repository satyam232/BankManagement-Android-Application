# BankManagement-Android-Application

A Bank Management system which contains a good logic based on transfer money , profile , PIN creating, with a fine navigation drawer, its a simple project we all should do in our btech 1st year, or while you are learning oops
(object oriented programming) it will make you learn and clear so many logics like whats going on inside an app and how it really work, 
you will get to know about APIs, as when i was starting it i was hated the word APIs then when i envolved in this project i fully got to know what it actally is and seriously is a mind blowing...
i hope this project will help you a lot thanks,
